Project Details:

OS Used: 	   Windows 7/10
System Type:   64-bit Operating System

Language Used: Java
Compiler/Running environment: Java Development Kit (JDK) is required on the machine in which you
	want to run the program. Java Runtime Environment (JRE) should be fine to run the program as
	well.

Download Java SDK for your architecture using the following URL: 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Build/Run: I used Eclipse IDE for this project. Inside eclipse create a new java project
		   and put all the .java files in one package and call it "proj3". Project3.java contains main(), run it 
		   and the game should start.

NOTE: The images folder was initially provided. Put this folder inside the proj3 package/folder for the project to run correctly. 

Files initially provided:
1) Project3.java
2) Suit.java
3) Rank.java
4) ClickableImage.java
5) ClickableImageGrid.java

Files written by me:
1) Card.java
2) Deck.java
3) Coordinate.java
4) Tableau.java
5) Game.java

Comments: This was a very interesting project and required a lot of reverse engineering. Doing this project will
		  give you a great deal of practice with object oriented design. If you are interested in recreating this
		  game, read the project description in the PDF file and go from there. Good Luck!
